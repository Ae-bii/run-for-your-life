# Run For Your Life

Written By Anupam Bhakta and Dylan Lian

The difference from our initial project idea was that instead of doing the classic offline Google Chrome dino game, we made a similar game with free vertical movement as opposed to utilizing a jump and gravity element so that we didn't clone the original game. We were able to include a scrolling background, animated sprites, random spawn rates, a thematic font scheme, a lives mechanic, and a score mechanic, some of which are not in the original game.

In order to play this game, just run the .jar file (or the main method inside the GameManager class), and use the mouse to interact with the onscreen "play" buttons. Use the "W" and "S" keys to move up and down, or use the up and down arrow keys if you prefer using those instead.

The most challenging part of this project was creating the replay mechanics (the last 1% of the project) because of the order in which we had to reinitialize the game. The other major challenge was in the beginning when we were figuring out how to animate our main character sprite. Besides that, the project was straightforward since the movement mechanics of the obstacles and items appering on screen were relatively similar, and many of the aspects of our game carried over concepts from other projects we had done already this semester.
